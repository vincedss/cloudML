This project is used to get the risk of credit default payment in a B2C context. It shows how to leverage historical transactional data combined with new data. A good way of starting the demo is to start with the [dashboard](dashboard:jFCVNwU) in order to illustrate the visual capabilities provided by Dataiku DSS. Also, the dashboard embeds a nice webapp, showing an example of "how to leverage your model in real time, for business user?".

<br />

Here is a quick definition of what the **credit default payment** means:

> “In finance, default is failure to meet the legal obligations (or conditions) of a loan,[1] for example when a home buyer fails to make a mortgage payment, or when a corporation or government fails to pay a bond which has reached maturity. A national or sovereign default is the failure or refusal of a government to repay its national debt.”

<i class="icon-dkubird" /> **DSS** also provides to capabilities to integrate with BI tools like PowerBI. I usually end my demo by showing the [PowerBI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjE4Mjc3OWQtMDQ0Yi00M2M1LWE0NGEtMmZlMDc0YmFjYTE2IiwidCI6IjdlZjU1ZDQwLTUzZDctNGQyYS05YjIwLWIwMTU1MTIxYmNiYiIsImMiOjl9).
